# Objective
To setup a cluser of capture devices (Raspberry Pi + SDR) across the city recording IQ values. Then have a public facing website [radio-mapper.org](https://radio-mapper.org) that aggregates processed IQ data to give you a google map location of radio sources.


## Research
Stefan Scholl presented this [Experiments on Transmitter Localization with TDOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km4TU17b05s&t=925s). You can see in the slide a link to async_rearrangements branch of librtlsdr. This is a good starting point for this project.
